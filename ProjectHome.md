gaedriver is a tool to automate end-to-end test for App Engine apps.

A Python Tutorial is available here: [PythonTutorial](http://code.google.com/p/gaedriver/wiki/PythonTutorial).


## Motivation ##
Before you can run an end-to-end test, you need to bring up your test environment. For App Engine apps, this means starting dev\_appserver or deploying an application. The gaedriver package allows you to do those things with an API.


## Current status ##

pre-alpha - We try to understand what's needed and how we can solve it in the scope of this project.


## Download ##

You can download gaedriver from PyPI directly: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/gaedriver/ or use your favorite local PyPI interface, for example pip:
